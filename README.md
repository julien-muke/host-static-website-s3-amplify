## <a name="introduction">ü§ñ Introduction</a>

Deploying a WordPress website on AWS involves leveraging various AWS services to ensure scalability, reliability, and security. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of setting up a WordPress site using Amazon EC2 for hosting, Amazon RDS for database management, and Amazon Application Load Balancer (ALB) for efficient traffic distribution.

Additionally, we will utilize Amazon Route 53 for domain name management and DNS routing. This comprehensive approach not only simplifies the deployment process but also equips your WordPress site with the robust infrastructure needed to handle varying levels of traffic, ensuring optimal performance and uptime.


## üìê Architecture Diagram Overview

* Users will request to open WordPress website, that request will be received by Route 53 which is a domain Management Service in AWS.
* We will use Route 53 to host DNS entries of the website's domain.
* Route 53 will send request to Application Load Balancer (ALB), it handles distribution of the traffic, if you have multiple instances of the same website, it will handle all the incoming requests. 
* ALB also support SSL certificate through AWS Certificate Manager, we will use it to issue a new SSL certificate for our domain name and ALB will apply that SSL certificate and send request to EC2 instance.
* EC2 instance is a virtual server where we will install all the needed packages to run WordPress  and create files of our WordPress website.
* We will make EC2 and RDS accessible to public source and enforce security via Security Group rules.
* We will create an EC2 instance which will be our Virtual Server and RDS instance which will be used for Database Hosting.

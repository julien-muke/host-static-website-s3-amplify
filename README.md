## <a name="introduction">ü§ñ Introduction</a>

Static websites are an efficient and cost-effective way to deliver content to users, as they consist of pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side processing. Hosting such websites on AWS provides a scalable, reliable, and secure solution, leveraging the cloud provider's global infrastructure.

AWS offers multiple services to simplify static website hosting. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) allows you to store and serve static files with high availability and minimal cost. AWS Amplify, a development and hosting platform, streamlines deployment and continuous integration for modern web applications. To ensure seamless access and custom domain management, Amazon Route 53, AWS's DNS service, plays a crucial role in routing user requests to your website.

In this guide, you'll learn how to use these AWS services together to host a static website. We'll cover:

1. Setting up a static website using Amazon S3 with public file hosting.
2. Deploying and managing your website using AWS Amplify for a streamlined CI/CD pipeline.
3. Configuring custom domains and DNS routing with Amazon Route 53 to make your website accessible to the world.


## üìê Architecture Diagram Overview

* Users will request to open WordPress website, that request will be received by Route 53 which is a domain Management Service in AWS.
* We will use Route 53 to host DNS entries of the website's domain.
* Route 53 will send request to Application Load Balancer (ALB), it handles distribution of the traffic, if you have multiple instances of the same website, it will handle all the incoming requests. 
* ALB also support SSL certificate through AWS Certificate Manager, we will use it to issue a new SSL certificate for our domain name and ALB will apply that SSL certificate and send request to EC2 instance.
* EC2 instance is a virtual server where we will install all the needed packages to run WordPress  and create files of our WordPress website.
* We will make EC2 and RDS accessible to public source and enforce security via Security Group rules.
* We will create an EC2 instance which will be our Virtual Server and RDS instance which will be used for Database Hosting.

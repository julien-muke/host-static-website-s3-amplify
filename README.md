## <a name="introduction">ü§ñ Introduction</a>

Static websites are an efficient and cost-effective way to deliver content to users, as they consist of pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side processing. Hosting such websites on AWS provides a scalable, reliable, and secure solution, leveraging the cloud provider's global infrastructure.

AWS offers multiple services to simplify static website hosting. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) allows you to store and serve static files with high availability and minimal cost. AWS Amplify, a development and hosting platform, streamlines deployment and continuous integration for modern web applications. To ensure seamless access and custom domain management, Amazon Route 53, AWS's DNS service, plays a crucial role in routing user requests to your website.

In this guide, you'll learn how to use these AWS services together to host a static website. We'll cover:

1. Setting up a static website using Amazon S3 with public file hosting.
2. Deploying and managing your website using AWS Amplify for a streamlined CI/CD pipeline.
3. Configuring custom domains and DNS routing with Amazon Route 53 to make your website accessible to the world.

- Amazon Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- AWS Amplify
- Amazon Route 53

## <a name="quick-start">ü§∏ Quick Start</a>

Before starting this guide, you will need:

**Prerequisites**

- [Create an AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- Static website source code (html, css and javascript) used in the video can be found [here]()
- Custom Domain with [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/get-a-domain/) or use a 3rd party domain registrar for example [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/)


## <a name="steps">‚òëÔ∏è Steps</a>

The procedure for deploying this architecture on AWS consists of the following steps:

* Step 1. [Create a bucket](#create-a-bucket)
* Step 2. [Upload files to S3](#upload-files-to-s3)
* Step 3. [Create a new Amplify App](#create-a-new-amplify-app)
* Step 4. [Add a custom domain name with Amazon Route 53](#custom-doamin-with-route-53)


## <a name="create-a-bucket">‚û°Ô∏è Step 1 - Create a bucket</a>

To create a bucket

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.
2. Choose Create bucket.
3. Enter the Bucket name.
4. Choose the Region where you want to create the bucket.
5. Choose a Region that is geographically close to you to minimize latency and costs, or to address regulatory requirements. The Region that you choose determines your Amazon S3 website endpoint. For more information, see 
[Website endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteEndpoints.html).
6. To accept the default settings and create the bucket, choose Create.

## <a name="upload-files-to-s3">‚û°Ô∏è Step 2 - Upload files to S3</a>

This procedure explains how to upload objects and folders to an Amazon S3 bucket by using the console.

To upload folders and files to an S3 bucket:

1. In the Buckets list, choose the name of the bucket that you want to upload your folders or files to, then click `View details`.

2. Choose Upload.

3. In the Upload window, Drag and drop files and folders to the Upload window.

4. To upload your files, choose Upload.

Note: If you want the static website used in this tutorial, you can find the source code [here]()

Amazon S3 uploads your files. When the upload completes, you can see a success message on the Upload status page.

## <a name="create-a-new-amplify-app">‚û°Ô∏è Step 3 - Create a new Amplify App</a>

If you done this in the past, you might know that to host your static website on Amazon S3 was just enable `static website hosting on S3` and you can still do that at least for now.

But now the recommendation is to go with amplify instead. There is a new way to host a static website on AWS, it includes S3 as well as amplify hosting. There have been some changes and very recently the recommendation changed to using amplify hosting instead of only S3.

Now, to host static website with AWS Amplify with content stored on S3:

1. From the Amazon S3 Console, click on `Properties` then scroll down to `static website hosting`
2. Click on `Create Amplify App`

3. That'll open up a new tab and take us to the amplify console and here it's basically created a new app for us it's linking it up to the the S3 bucket and all we have to do is save and deploy.

## üí∞ Cost

All services used are eligible for the AWS Free Tier. However, charges will incur at some point so it's recommended that you shut down resources after completing this tutorial.
